- Some render pipelines (like the HDRP) don't play nice with the default-diffuse material, which was used for rendering shadow only meshes.

	which seems to work on all renderpipelines. (issue #267)
- Fixed errors in 2018.3 where it was complaining that shadow only meshrenderers do not have normals, which are required for "lightmapping"?
	these shadow-only meshrenderers are now always set to never be lightmap/reflection-probe static
